# Prebuilt FLINT Binaries

<http://www.flintlib.org/>

Originally built on OSX by Lucas Garron in 2013.

## Versions

- flint-2.3
  - mpfr-3.1.2
  - mpir-2.3.1

## WARNING

These libraries may:

- not be properly optimized and
- possibly not pass `make check`.

Use at your own risk. Of course, it might be preferable to try `flint` *at all*. Hence, this repo.
